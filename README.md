# Dijkstra-Algorithms
This project implements Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to calculate the shortest paths in a weighted, undirected graph. The graph is read from a plain text file in edge list format, where each line contains a source node, destination node, and weight. The program accepts command-line arguments for the input file name and the starting node.
